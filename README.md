# PacMan-GO-
This is the write up for recreating a game (for educational purposes) me and some project partners thought of that. It is a mix between PacMan and the game of Go! We created all the circuit schematics, wrote the arduino code from scratch, did all the CAD rendering, and edited a Pacman game we found under the Add-Ons section of Matlab. We outlined the steps in as easy to follow detail as possible so that freshmen could possibly recreate this game.
