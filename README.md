# PacMan-GO-
This is the write up for recreating a game (for educational purposes) me and some project partners thought of. It is a mix between PacMan and the game of Go! We created all the circuit schematics, wrote the arduino code from scratch, did all the CAD rendering, and edited a Pacman game we found under the Add-Ons section of Matlab. We outlined the steps in an as easy to follow manner as possible so that college freshmen could possibly recreate this game.

Checkout Lab 5 â€“ ECE 5.pdf for the full write-up (inlucing circuit schematics, copy of all code, and high-level design), Challenge3.ino for the arduino code, and Pacman.m for our Matlab integration.
